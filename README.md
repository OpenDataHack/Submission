# Project submission templates for the OpenDataHack

Project submission consists of two elements: 

- a repository and 
- a project description. 

The project description can done in HackPad (an example is [here](https://hackpad.com/Project-submission-template-Xh6U3CMlDYc)) or by adding a descriptive README to your repo (see [Project_submission_template.md](Project_submission_template.md)).
